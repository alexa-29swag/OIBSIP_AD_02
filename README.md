TO DO APP

I'm excited to share that I've successfully completed the development of my To-Do List App as part of my learning journey in Android development! 📱
This project helped me strengthen my skills in:
🧠 Java & XML for clean UI and functionality
 📱 Login & Signup Activity added for secured access
🧩 RecyclerView for dynamic task management
💾 SQLite/Room DB for local data storage
📝 Add, Edit, Delete features for task management
🔔 Plans to add notifications and cloud sync in future versions!
Building this app has been a rewarding hands-on experience that reinforced key development principles and UI/UX practices.
